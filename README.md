#### About me
⚒️ I am currently working on a web app where BMW owners can find aftermarket parts and vehicle modifications based on their year, make, and model.

👨‍🏫 I am currently getting into full-stack development and learning how to work with the MERN stack (**MongoDB**, **Express,js**, **React.js**, and **Node.js**).

🤝 I am willing to collaborate on any projects.

📝 I am open to feedback on my projects.

💖 I have a passion for bodybuilding and cars.
